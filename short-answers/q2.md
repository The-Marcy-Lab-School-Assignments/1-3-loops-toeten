# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
Yes. We can remove the `if` statement and modify the condition of the `for` loop as follows:
`(let i = 0; i < 8; i++)`
This will result in the loop terminating at 7 and logging the same output as the previous function.
